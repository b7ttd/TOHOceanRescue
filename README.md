[jwz's website (possibly the best website ever)](https://www.jwz.org/)
## Things I Need the Website to Have
- Handbook for Rookies, with tips and training and such.
- Information for days cancelled.
- Information for weather tips and the tides. 
- Maps of each park?
- A mod.php panel for employees.
- Down the road, a way for people to submit files.

## Things to Work On
- Not sure where I will put the PDFs, currently they are just in the main folder 
website. 
troubleshooting now.

## Things to remember
- I'm using nginx now, so no need to have the Django files.
