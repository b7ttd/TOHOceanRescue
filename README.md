*Taking inspiration* from the following websites:

[Inspiration Website](https://www.rehobothbeachpatrol.com/)

[Junior Lifeguarding Website](https://hempsteadny.gov/891/Junior-Ocean-Lifeguarding)

[Gone With the Blastwave, for Inspiration](https://www.blastwave-comic.com)

[jwz's website (possibly the best website ever)](https://www.jwz.org/)
## Things I Need the Website to Have
- Handbook for Rookies, with tips and training and such.
- Information for days cancelled.
- Information for weather tips and the tides. 
- Maps of each park?
- A mod.php panel for employees.
- Down the road, a way for people to submit files.

## Things to Work On
- Not sure where I will put the PDFs, currently they are just in the main folder 
website. 
- Figure out how to use Django to host the website. It'll work for 
troubleshooting now.

## Things to remember
- Remember when using Django, store all html templates in /templates.

## Yeah
